This backup version provides an option to use local files containing positive/negative sentences
as testing sentence or to use 5331 positive sentences and 5331 negative sentences in sentence_polarity
as testing sentences.

But since 5331+5331 sentences need a huge amount of lexica, so it was not implemented in the grammar.
But this backup was saved for potential future implementation.
