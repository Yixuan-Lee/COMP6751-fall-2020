* unit_gazetteer.txt: unit of measurement gazetteer

There are 2 reports in the report directory:

* P1_Report1_Pipeline.pdf: show the pipeline and modules
* P1_Report2_Demo.pdf: show the result of test cases

In "PreProcess.py", there are two TODOs. By default, it downloads 
the reuters corpora first to retrieve the files.

TODO_1:

TODO_2:
Change fileid to try different test cases.
